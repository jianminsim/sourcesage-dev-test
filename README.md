# sourcesage-dev-test

For Software Engineering roles:
Create a Q & A application that has the following functionality.
1. a user can ask a question
2. a user can answer a question
3. Answers from users are posted to other users in real-time

Add-ons:
(Mobile)
- Support push notification

(Web)
- Tagging for topics & statistics on topics

You can write this application in whatever languages you prefer.
For Backend developers: We like Python, Erlang (but we really don't mind if you write it in other languages)
For iOS and Android developers: Do you even have another choice?

Things to look out:
- Ability to craft quality codes (project structure, variable naming, ...)
- Well-thought Data Schema (if any): schema is efficient for read/write, use of indexing, query is optimized


You should fork this repository and put your work there. 
This exercise should take no longer than 2 days. However, you are not timed
and you can send us a pull request whenever you finish. (If you have something 
live going on, even better!)
